## Moodle text formats

Moodle stores textual data in a range of formats. 

- Moodle Text
- HTML 
- unformated Text
- Markdown 

These formats are internally associated to numbers and it is quite hard to get these numbers from the code. So here they are:

- Moodle Text: 0
- HTML: 1
- unformatted Text: 2
- Markdown: 4

Note that there is NO 3 as format.
